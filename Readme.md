# Code Review Checker
Checks GitHub and Phabricator for Code Review that you need to do.

# Platform support
MacOS only for the moment.

# Developing
You'll need `esy` (`npm i -g esy`), and that should be it!

`esy start` will get it running for you.
`esy pkg` will pack it all up into a `.app` for you to run, and a zip archive.
